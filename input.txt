I got a dead soul, I been facing blunts of my enemies
Emotions bottled up, I don't know what's wrong and it's killing me
I cut so many off, my heart cold as December be
My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don't get no sleep
You don't understand how hard it was, I swear this shit so deep
I made it to the top and they all looked up in disbelief
They hate that I'm doin' better, they'd much rather get rid of me
I flex with no regrets 'cause they ain't show me no sympathy
I came a long way but I ain't as far as I'm finna be
I promise I'ma die a legend, I'ma make sure that you remember me
